# Ebrains Metadata Wizard

The EBRAINS Metadata Wizard is a freely accessible web-based service designed to assist researchers in generating structured, FAIR-compliant metadata for neuroscience research products (datasets) intended for registration in the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph. It offers an intuitive interface that allows users to edit metadata according to the openMINDS standard directly from their web browser. Built on a form-driven frontend, it features interactive validation, helpful tooltips, and structured guidance to ensure that users can easily create and modify metadata. The Metadata Wizard's backend server dynamically generates JSON-LD compliant with the openMINDS framework and uploads metadata to the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph.
