div is a box, by default is block element
div can contain any other elements inside the box


“Floats” let you put block-level elements side-by-side instead of on top of each other.
Float-based layouts have mostly been replaced with Flexbox in modern websites.
Our recommendation is to use flexbox to lay out your web pages as much as possible, 
reserving floats for when you need text to flow around a box (i.e., a magazine-style layout) 
or when you need to support legacy web browsers.
